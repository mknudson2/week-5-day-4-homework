# week-5-day-4-homework

The original plan was to add a single procedure for a new customer and then write another function. However, it ended up being messier than that.
In order to add the new customer—especially since I was also going to have them be from a new address, city, and country entry—I ended up needing to 
make procedures for each step, totaling 4 at the end. 
My functions ended up being updates to values that I had previously messed up. So I got it all there, but it was a bit more of ride than originally
anticipated.
